# Permission Fix for Company-Specific AI Assistants

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: Wazen users were getting "You don't have permission to view this thread" error when trying to access chat threads created with their company-specific AI assistant (`wazen_ai_assistant`).

**Root Cause**: The `ai_assistant_can_view_thread` function in `saia/permissions.py` was only checking for the default `customer_data_assistant` but not for company-specific assistants like `wazen_ai_assistant`.

## 🔍 **Analysis**

### **Thread Analysis**
- **Thread 84**: Created with `assistant_id: wazen_ai_assistant` (company-specific)
- **User**: `wazen` (Customer user, Company: Wazen)
- **Permission Check**: Failed because function only allowed `customer_data_assistant` threads

### **Permission Function Issue**
```python
# OLD CODE (BROKEN)
if hasattr(user, 'is_customer') and user.is_customer:
    return thread.assistant_id == CustomerDataAIAssistant.id  # Only default assistant
```

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Enhanced Permission Function**
Updated `ai_assistant_can_view_thread` in `saia/permissions.py` to support:

1. **Default Customer Assistant**: `customer_data_assistant` (backward compatibility)
2. **Company-Specific Assistants**: `wazen_ai_assistant`, `otek_ai_assistant`, etc.
3. **Legacy Assistants**: `hybrid_customer_assistant` (backward compatibility)

### **New Logic**
```python
# Customer users can see customer data assistant threads OR their company-specific assistant threads
if hasattr(user, 'is_customer') and user.is_customer:
    # Allow default customer assistant threads
    if thread.assistant_id == CustomerDataAIAssistant.id:
        return True
    
    # Allow company-specific assistant threads if user belongs to that company
    if hasattr(user, 'company') and user.company:
        company_assistant_id = user.company.get_company_assistant_id()
        if company_assistant_id and thread.assistant_id == company_assistant_id:
            return True
    
    # Also allow legacy assistant IDs for backward compatibility
    legacy_assistant_ids = ['hybrid_customer_assistant']
    if thread.assistant_id in legacy_assistant_ids:
        return True
    
    return False
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Before Fix**
```
👤 User: wazen (Company: Wazen)
🧵 Thread: New Chat Session (Assistant: wazen_ai_assistant)
✅ Permission result: DENIED ❌
```

### **After Fix**
```
👤 User: wazen (Company: Wazen)
🧵 Thread: New Chat Session (Assistant: wazen_ai_assistant)

View Thread: ✅ ALLOWED
Update Thread: ✅ ALLOWED
Delete Thread: ✅ ALLOWED
Create Message: ✅ ALLOWED
Run Wazen Assistant: ✅ ALLOWED

🎉 ALL PERMISSIONS WORKING CORRECTLY!
```

## 🔒 **Security Maintained**

### **Security Principles Preserved**
- ✅ **User Ownership**: Users can only access their own threads
- ✅ **Company Isolation**: Users can only access their company's assistant
- ✅ **Context Separation**: Admin and customer threads remain isolated
- ✅ **Superuser Access**: Superusers can access everything

### **Permission Matrix**
| User Type | Default Assistant | Company Assistant | Other Company Assistant | Admin Assistant |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Customer  | ✅ Allowed       | ✅ Allowed (own)  | ❌ Denied              | ❌ Denied       |
| Admin     | ❌ Denied        | ❌ Denied         | ❌ Denied              | ✅ Allowed      |
| Superuser | ✅ Allowed       | ✅ Allowed        | ✅ Allowed             | ✅ Allowed      |

## 🚀 **Impact**

### **Fixed Issues**
- ✅ Wazen users can now access their company-specific AI assistant threads
- ✅ All other company users will have the same access to their assistants
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing threads
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced

### **Affected Functions**
All these functions now work correctly with company-specific assistants:
- `ai_assistant_can_view_thread`
- `ai_assistant_can_update_thread` 
- `ai_assistant_can_delete_thread`
- `ai_assistant_can_create_message`
- `ai_assistant_can_run_assistant` (already worked)

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. **`saia/permissions.py`**
   - Enhanced `ai_assistant_can_view_thread` function
   - Added support for company-specific assistants
   - Maintained backward compatibility

## 🎯 **Best Practices Applied**

1. **Security First**: Maintained all existing security constraints
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing threads continue to work
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Tested all permission functions
4. **Clear Documentation**: Documented the fix and reasoning
5. **Minimal Changes**: Only modified what was necessary

---

**The permission system now fully supports the company-specific AI assistant architecture while maintaining security and backward compatibility.**
